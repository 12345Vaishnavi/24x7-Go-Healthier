        <h2><i>Why Health Care :- </i> </h2>
        <p >
            With a population of more than 1.4 Billion, last-mile delivery of healthcare in our country is a big challenge. 
            The geospatial diversity of the country further aggravates the issues of accessibility and availability of healthcare in difficult terrains. <br>
            With more than 65% of the population residing in rural areas with a smaller share of the overall healthcare infrastructure, 
            and the urban slum dwellers prioritising everyday survival over healthcare, uneven distribution and lack of awareness also limit the uptake of existing
             healthcare services. It is crucial to address these gaps to meet the goals of Universal Health Coverage and support Govt of India's vision of Ayushman Bharat.

        </p>
        <h2><i>What we do..?</i></h2>
        <p>
            Smile Foundationâ€™s comprehensive and community-centric health programme takes primary healthcare services to the doorsteps of underserved communities in both rural and urban India. Following a two pronged approach, 
            the programme provides curative as well as preventive services, addressing the gaps in availability, accessibility and affordability of healthcare.
