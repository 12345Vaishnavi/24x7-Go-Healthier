          <div>In Rutu Ayurveda we combine ancient Ayurvedic knowledge with modern diagnostic
            methods to diagnose the cause of disease and the treatment. Our aim is to use the

            A holistic approach is an important factor in the treatment of a patient.
            Aurveda has explained the examination of disease (Rog Pariksha) & diseased (Rogi Pariksha)
            in most comprehensive way. It is very important to know the nature of disease and 
            status of the patient before starting the treatment. Dashavidh Pariksha is an important
            format explained by Ayurveda.</div>

            Patient satisfaction is the measure of how happy and content are patients with their
            healthcare experience, comprising factors such as quality of care received, 
            communication with healthcare providers or doctors, access to services, and overall 
            hospital or clinic experience. Patient experience at all touchpoints like appointment 
            booking, waiting, doctor‚Äôs interaction, hospital staff interaction, bill payment, etc. 
            have a direct impact on it.

          <div>Quality of care is the degree to which health services for individuals and populations
             increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes.It is based on evidence-based
             professional knowledge and is critical for achieving universal health coverage.
             As countries commit to achieving Health for All, it is imperative to carefully consider
             the quality of care and health services.  Quality health care can be defined in many
             ways but there is growing acknowledgement that quality health services should be:
             Effective ‚Äì providing evidence-based healthcare services to those who need them;
            Safe ‚Äì avoiding harm to people for whom the care is intended; and
            People-centred ‚Äì providing care that responds to individual preferences, needs and values.</div>
