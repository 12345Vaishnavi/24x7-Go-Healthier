            Today’s companies in the health and wellness space are plagued by rising costs,
            staffing issues, and increasingly strict regulation that makes it difficult to keep
            the lights on—much less thrive. As a result, healthcare teams are under incredible
            pressure to maximize resources, reduce overhead, and adopt effective project management systems. 
            The ability to plan, manage, and successfully execute projects has a direct impact on your
            org’s reputation, bottom line, and employee morale. But the stakes are even higher for
            healthcare project management.
